EXPLANATION OF THE GAME

The game starts in the "Hallway" and allows the player to move between rooms (Living Room, Kitchen, Garden) or quit the game by entering a number corresponding to their choice.
Each room change updates the current_room variable and prints a message confirming the new location.
The game continues until the player chooses to quit.
