EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The code begins by initializing an empty list catalog to store books, with each book represented as a tuple containing details like title, author, genre, and year.
Three functions are defined: add_book, find_book, and display_books.
add_book function adds a new book to the catalog list as a tuple.
find_book function searches for a book by its title within the catalog.
display_books function prints out all the books currently stored in the catalog, showing their details.
Sample books are added using add_book.
The display_books function is called to show all books in the catalog.
A specific book ("1984") is searched for using find_book, and the result is printed.
Another book ("The Catcher in the Rye") is added to the catalog using add_book.
Finally, the display_books function is called again to show the updated catalog.
