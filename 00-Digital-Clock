EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The code imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions and constants in Python.
It defines a function digital_clock() that continuously displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds format (HH:MM:SS).
Inside the function, there is an infinite loop (while True:) that runs continuously until stopped.
Within the loop, time.strftime("%H:%M:%S") retrieves the current time formatted as hours, minutes, and seconds.
print(current_time, end="\r") prints the current time to the console, using "\r" to overwrite the previous output, creating the illusion of a continuously updating digital clock.
time.sleep(1) pauses the program for 1 second before repeating the loop, ensuring the clock updates once per second.

"""
NOTIONS COVERED

Interpreting and the interpreter: The Python interpreter executes the code continuously, updating the time display.
Lexis, syntax, and semantics: The code uses correct syntax and semantics for Python functions and time-related operations.
Keywords: import, def, while, True, print, time.sleep
Instructions: Function definition (def), loop (while True:), function call (digital_clock())
Indentation: Correct indentation ensures the loop and function are properly structured.
Comments: Comments are used to explain the purpose of the function and clarify steps within the code.
Literals: Time literals ("%H:%M:%S") for formatting the time.
Variables: current_time stores the formatted time.
Naming conventions: Follows PEP-8 guidelines (e.g., digital_clock, current_time).
Input/output console operations: Uses print() function to display time.
sep= and end= keyword parameters: Uses end="\r" to overwrite the previous output.
