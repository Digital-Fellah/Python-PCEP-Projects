# Interactive Quiz Game
# This program implements a simple quiz game where questions are displayed
# on an Arduino-compatible display and users can answer using buttons.

# Define quiz questions and answers as a list of tuples

    ("What is the largest planet in our solar system?", ["Jupiter"]),
    ("Which country is famous for kangaroos?", ["Australia"]),
    ("How many continents are there?", ["7"]),
]

EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Initialization: The program starts by importing the random module and defining a list of quiz questions and their corresponding correct answers.
Shuffling: The questions list is shuffled using random.shuffle() to randomize the order of questions for each game session.
Quiz Loop: The main loop iterates through each question-answer pair in questions.
Each question is printed on the display using print().
The user is prompted to input their answer using input().
The user's answer is checked against the correct answers using a conditional statement (if).
If the answer is correct, the program prints "Correct!" and increments the score.
If the answer is incorrect, the program prints the correct answer(s).
End of Quiz: After all questions have been asked and answered, the program prints the final score.

NOTIONS COVERED

Conditional Statements (if-else): Used to check if the user's answer is correct and provide appropriate feedback.
Loops (for): Used to iterate through each question in the questions list.
Iterating through sequences: The for loop iterates through the questions list to display each question sequentially.
Control Flow (break): No break statements are used in this specific implementation.
Importing Modules: Imported the random module for shuffling the questions.
