"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by importing the random module to generate random numbers.
It initializes an empty list rolls to store the results of dice rolls.
It enters an infinite loop (while True) where it prompts the user to press Enter to roll the dice.
Inside the loop, it generates random numbers (dice1 and dice2) representing the results of rolling two dice.
It stores each roll as a tuple (dice1, dice2) in the rolls list.
After rolling, it prints the results of the dice roll.
It asks the user if they want to roll again (again = input("Roll again? (yes/no): ")).
If the user enters anything other than "yes", the loop breaks and the program proceeds to calculate and print statistics based on the rolls:
Total number of rolls (total_rolls).
Number of times doubles (both dice showing the same number) were rolled (doubles_count).
Average of all dice rolls (average_roll).
Frequency of each possible roll combination (roll_counts).

"""
NOTIONS COVERED

Conditional Statements (if-else, if-elif): Used to check if the user wants to roll again and to break the loop accordingly.
Loops (while): Used to repeatedly roll the dice until the user decides to stop.
Control Flow (break): Used to exit the loop when the user does not want to roll again.
