EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The code begins by welcoming the player to the Interactive Story Game and explaining the premise.
It presents the player with choices at each stage of the story, allowing them to navigate through different scenarios based on their decisions.
Each choice leads to a different outcome or prompts further choices, shaping the storyline dynamically.

Keywords: Keywords like print(), input(), if, elif, else are used for user interaction and control flow.
Instructions: Each part of the story is structured with clear instructions and choices for the player.
Indentation: Proper indentation is used to define nested conditions and maintain code readability.
Comments: Comments are used extensively to explain each step of the game for beginners.
