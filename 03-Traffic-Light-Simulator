"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The code simulates a traffic light system with red, yellow, and green lights using LEDs connected to GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.
It sets up the GPIO pins for red, yellow, and green LEDs and initializes them.
The program enters an infinite loop (while True) to continuously cycle through the traffic light phases: red -> green -> yellow -> red.
Each phase is controlled by setting the appropriate GPIO output to HIGH (on) or LOW (off) and printing a message indicating which light is currently on.
The time.sleep() function pauses the program execution for a specified number of seconds to simulate each light's duration.
The loop continues indefinitely until the user interrupts it (KeyboardInterrupt), at which point it cleans up GPIO settings and exits gracefully.

"""
NOTIONS COVERED

Conditional Statements (if-else): Used implicitly to control which LEDs are turned on based on the traffic light phase.
Loops (while): Utilized to continuously cycle through the traffic light phases.
Control Flow (break, continue): Not explicitly used in this code but conceptually part of controlling the flow of the traffic light sequence.
