EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The code starts by initializing an empty dictionary grade_book to store grades for different subjects.
Two functions add_grade() and calculate_average() are defined to add grades for a subject and calculate the average grade respectively.
The display_grades() function iterates through the grade_book dictionary and prints each subject along with its list of grades.
Grades for two subjects, Math and Science, are added using the add_grade() function.
The display_grades() function is called to print all subjects and their respective grades.
Finally, the average grades for Math and Science are calculated and printed using the calculate_average() function.

NOTIONS COVERED

Lists (used indirectly through dictionary values which store lists of grades)
Dictionaries (used to store grades for each subject and their associated methods like items(), keys(), and values())
Keys (used to represent subjects in the grade_book dictionary)
Iterating through dictionaries (done in the display_grades() function)
Functions (used to encapsulate and reuse code for adding grades, calculating averages, and displaying grades)
Initializing loops (used in for loop inside display_grades() function)
Checking the existence of keys (if subject in grade_book statements)
Methods (append() method used to add grades to existing lists in add_grade() function)
